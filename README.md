# damje
A w3css styled doms generator and manipulator

# The story
it started when i need to write a dynamic website for my CV, so i thought why not to use JS to create easy to edit and use one, then it moved to be an idea of full library to generate HTML files easily.

# the name:
thought about a good name that can combine DOMs and JS, so came with the Damje "دمج" an arabic name means "combine", at the same time its made from the same letters of DOM-JS with a small modification.
